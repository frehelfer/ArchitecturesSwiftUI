# ArchitecturesSwiftUI
SwiftUI-MVVM Architecture Comparison Project

## Introduction

This project is an addition to the [ArchitecturesUIKit](https://github.com/frehelfer/ArchitecturesUIKit) comparison of different software architectural patterns, specifically Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator (MVVM-C) and View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity (VIP). The project is a simple iOS app implemented using SwiftUI that implements a login view and a list that displays data fetched from an API.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the differences and benefits of the MVVM architecture pattern and how it can be applied to an app.

## Key Features

- Login view implemented using Firebase
- List that displays data fetched from an API
- UI built using SwiftUI

## MVVM Architecture

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture is a software architecture pattern that provides a clear separation of concerns between the data (Model), the user interface (View), and the logic that controls the user interface (ViewModel). In MVVM, the ViewModel is responsible for transforming the data from the Model into a format that can be displayed by the View, while the View is responsible for presenting the data to the user.

## Conclusion

This project provides a demonstration of the MVVM architecture pattern applied to a simple iOS app built using SwiftUI. The MVVM pattern provides a clear separation of concerns and can make it easier to develop, test, and maintain your app.
